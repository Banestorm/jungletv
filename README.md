[JungleTV](https://jungletv.live/) is a video sharing website for the Banano community. [Banano](https://banano.cc/) is a feeless, instant, environment-friendly cryptocurrency that's ripe for memes.

On JungleTV, users can earn Banano by watching YouTube videos that are added by other users to a sort of continuously evolving playlist - the **queue**. The videos play in sync for everyone, making the experience similar to watching TV or a livestream.

You will have to spend some Banano to [enqueue a video](https://jungletv.live/enqueue). How much you must spend is determined by factors like the amount of people watching and the length of the queue.

The Banano spent to enqueue each video is distributed among the JungleTV spectators who our fraud prevention monkeys deem sufficiently ripe. Make sure to [set your address to earn rewards](https://jungletv.live/rewards/address)! If you watch enough videos, you'll eventually make enough to enqueue your own - or to recover your initial spending!
